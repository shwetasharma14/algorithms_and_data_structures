    "## Time Complexity:\n",
    "The time complexity of the is_duplicate function can be analyzed by looking at the operations performed during the level-order traversal:\n",
    "1. Initialization: Adding the root node to the queue is a constant time operation, O(1)O(1).\n",
    "2. Level-Order Traversal: The function performs a level-order traversal using a queue, processing each node exactly once. This traversal involves:\n",
    "    - Dequeueing a node: O(1)O(1)\n",
    "    - Checking if the value is in the seen set: O(1)O(1) on average, assuming hash set operations.\n",
    "    - Adding the value to the seen set: O(1)O(1) on average.\n",
    "    - Enqueueing the left and right children: O(1)O(1) each.\n",
    "3. Since each node is processed once, and each operation (check, add, enqueue) is O(1)O(1), the overall time complexity is: O(n)O(n), where nn is the number of nodes in the binary tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Space Complexity:\n",
    "The space complexity of the is_duplicate function is determined by the additional data structures used:\n",
    "1. Queue: In the worst case, the queue can hold all the nodes at the deepest level of the tree. For a complete binary tree, this is O(n)O(n).\n",
    "2. Set: The seen set stores each unique value in the binary tree. In the worst case, if all node values are unique, the set will store nn values, giving it a space complexity of O(n)O(n).\n",

    "### Reflection on Implementing the `missing_num` Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Developing the `missing_num` function was an insightful exercise in applying set operations for efficient problem-solving. The primary objective was to identify missing numbers from a list of integers within a given range `[0, n]`, and the task required a methodical approach to ensure accuracy and efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Understanding the Problem**:\n",
    "The problem necessitated finding missing integers within a specified range, with the given list potentially containing duplicate values. The solution needed to account for this, ensuring that duplicates did not affect the identification of missing numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach and Implementation**:\n",
    "I opted to use Python's set operations due to their efficiency in handling membership checks and differences:\n",
    "1. **Determine the Range**: The maximum value in the input list (`max(nums)`) defined the upper bound `n` of the range.\n",
    "2. **Generate the Full Set**: Using `set(range(n + 1))`, I created a set of all integers within the range `[0, n]`.\n",
    "3. **Identify Missing Numbers**: By subtracting the set of given numbers (`given_set`) from the full set, I efficiently identified the missing numbers.\n",
    "4. **Convert to Sorted List**: The resulting set of missing numbers was converted to a sorted list for better readability and usability.\n",
    "5. **Handle Edge Cases**: The function was designed to return `-1` if no numbers were missing, ensuring it handled all potential scenarios gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Testing and Validation**:\n",
    "I tested the function with various inputs to validate its correctness:\n",
    "- **Basic Case**: `missing_num([0, 2])` returned `[1]`, correctly identifying the missing number.\n",
    "- **Multiple Missing Numbers**: `missing_num([5, 0, 1])` returned `[2, 3, 4]`, demonstrating the function's ability to handle multiple missing values.\n",
    "- **Complex Case**: `missing_num([6, 8, 2, 3, 5, 7, 0, 1, 10])` returned `[4, 9]`, validating the function's robustness with larger ranges and more values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reflection**:\n",
    "This assignment underscored the effectiveness of set operations for such tasks. The choice of sets ensured the solution was both efficient and easy to implement. Additionally, the task highlighted the importance of thorough testing, as it ensured that the function could handle various edge cases and input scenarios reliably. Overall, this was a valuable exercise in leveraging data structures for practical problem-solving in Python."
